# Taxi Revenue Optimization with Deep Q-Learning and Enhanced Data Visualization
This project explores the application of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to optimize taxi drivers' earnings by providing recommendations on which trips to accept, thereby enhancing urban taxi service efficiency. Utilizing real-world taxi trip data, the study integrates reinforcement learning with advanced data analytics and visualization tools, such as Google Cloud Platform, Mage-AI, and Tableau. This approach not only improves decision-making for drivers but also contributes to reducing urban congestion and pollution. The research showcases significant improvements in operational efficiency through increased cumulative profits and optimized trip selection, underpinned by detailed performance metrics. Ethical considerations and potential environmental impacts are also discussed, emphasizing the need for equitable, privacy-respecting, and environmentally sustainable urban transportation solutions.
